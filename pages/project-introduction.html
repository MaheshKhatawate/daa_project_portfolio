                <h2 class="card-question">1. Problem Space and Findings from the White Paper</h2>
                <div class="card-answer">
                    <p><strong>Problem Space:</strong> Patu city is experiencing rapid urban growth, with increasing
                        industrial and commercial development. This expansion has led to a significant shortage of
                        parking spaces. Drivers face the challenge of finding available parking, which results in wasted
                        time and fuel as they circle the city looking for a spot. The absence of an effective parking
                        management system exacerbates these issues, contributing to congestion and inefficiency in urban
                        mobility.</p>
                    <p><strong>How It Was Identified:</strong>The problem was identified through a combination of
                        observational data and feedback from residents and visitors of Patu city. Urban planners, local
                        authorities, and city dwellers reported long delays in locating parking spots, especially in the
                        newly developed industrial and commercial zones. Additionally, studies on traffic patterns
                        highlighted the inefficiency caused by drivers searching for parking, which increased traffic
                        congestion and environmental impact.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Findings from White Paper:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Increased Urbanization:</strong> Rapid expansion of business districts and
                            commercial spaces leads to a sharp increase in the number of vehicles, with parking
                            infrastructure failing to keep pace.</li>
                        <li><strong>Traffic Congestion:</strong> A significant portion of traffic congestion is caused
                            by drivers searching for parking spots, leading to longer travel times and increased fuel
                            consumption.</li>
                        <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong>The inefficiency in parking search contributes to
                            higher emissions and environmental degradation, especially as vehicles continue to circle
                            without finding parking.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Reflection on City Design:</strong>The design of Patu city, while accommodating growing
                        industrial and commercial spaces, has failed to integrate a sufficient parking strategy. The
                        areas with high traffic density are particularly affected, and urban planning has not
                        anticipated the parking demand generated by the rapid development of these areas. A redesign of
                        parking infrastructure, along with the introduction of smart parking solutions, would
                        significantly improve the overall design and functionality of the city.</p>
                    <p><strong>Business Case Identification:</strong>The implementation of a Smart Parking Management
                        System offers a compelling business case:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong>Reducing the time spent searching for parking leads to lower
                            fuel consumption, saving costs for drivers and reducing overall carbon emissions.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Improved Efficiency:</strong>The system optimizes parking space usage, ensuring that
                            available spots are effectively allocated, leading to better flow and less congestion.</li>
                        <li><strong>Revenue Generation:</strong>A smart parking system can generate revenue through a
                            subscription-based model, pay-per-use options, or advertisements integrated into the parking
                            management platform.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enhanced Urban Mobility:</strong>By resolving parking issues, the system helps
                            reduce traffic congestion, contributing to more efficient public transportation and smoother
                            overall city mobility.</li>
                    </ul>
